## Version Status
Development versions are maintained on ***Dev_Files directory***.
* **Ver_6:** Added calibration reference file and routine for "Head". Changed the markers configuration for the Torso rigid body.
* **Ver_5:** Calibration process requires a lot of human interaction (running the animations in Choregraphy, start recording in Motive, changing the animation to run on Choregraphy). Time coupling of the motion data (to make Human data comparable in time with the Nao's reference data for the calibration process) is done manually. Mimic is done from a stored choreography file in CSV format, no real-time streaming of data is used yet.
